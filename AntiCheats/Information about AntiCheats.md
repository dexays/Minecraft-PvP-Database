# Anticheats and all about them.
AntiCheats are for Minecraft servers like Hypixel, Minemen Club, The Hive, Mineplex and so much more. These servers use AntiCheats so no players can get an unfair advantage over other players, so to do this, they install anticheats.

Here are some very popular anticheats, and also the best anticheats for your server. Also this is **NOT** in order of best to worst.

### 1. Hypixel Watchdog
Okay, the Watchdog AntiCheat is not the best AntiCheat, with multiple hackers being in sight at all times, mainly Skywars and Bedwars. These give normal players no chance of winning games, making the server less enjoyable, but recently the AntiCheat has been having updates, a recent one is introducing Machine Learning, which helped the server by a bit, making hackers less common.
### 2. Minemen Club AntiGamingChair
This is commonly said as the best AntiCheat, which is kind of and kind of not true at the same time. Don't get me wrong, the AntiCheat is really good, but just that popular games such as Sumo are overran by cheaters ruining the gameplay of other players, so while it may be the best anticheat out of all other servers, its still not perfect, which, nothing is perfect so its fine.
### 3. Hive Anticheat
The AntiCheat is definitely worse then Hypixels AntiCheat, but its kinda unfair comparing Hive to Minemen and Hypixel, as its a Bedrock Edition Server. But even when the Java Edition server existed it still wasn't a good AntiCheat, with legit players getting kicked and banned, and hackers taking over the server. I think Hive can always improve, but recently, there has been no news about updating there AntiCheat (As of March 8, 2023). We really hope the Hive can fix there AntiCheat, but until then, we just have to hope.

### 4. Mineplex AntiCheat
No Information.

# Alright, now thats done, lets get to AntiCheats you should try out if your making a server.
We will first show paid anticheats, then we'll show all free AntiCheats.

# 1. Spartan AntiCheat PAID (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/spartan-advanced-anti-cheat-cheat-detection-hack-blocker-1-7-1-19-3.25638/)
This AntiCheat is insane, like amazing. The AntiCheat is compatible with many other plugins, such as GeyserMC, OldCombatMechanics, CrackShot, and MCMMO! This means you should get little to no false reports. It also has Discord Integration, meaning, by creating a webhook and connecting it to Spartan, you can view reports from Discord, isn't that just amazing? 
# 2. Sparky Anticheat PAID (https://sparky.ac/)
This is the best public AntiCheat, with features from other AntiCheats like Spartan, and even advanced Ghost Client detection, but 1 downside is the price is really high, its $200 for a lifetime license. The AntiCheat also has Cloud Based feature, Unlimited IP Whitelists, Advanced Combat Checks, and Advanced Movement checks. This AntiCheat is truly the best AntiCheat with all its features.
# More AntiCheats Coming Soon. Wait unti then!
