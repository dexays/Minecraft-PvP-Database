# Performance Mods for 1.17+
There are obviously multiple mods for performance, but here I've listed the most effective mods.
### 1. Sodium (https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)
You probably guessed this but Sodium is probably the **BEST** performance boosting mod for later versions.
### 2. Lithium (https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium)
This is a mod that works great when paired with Sodium, the mod is amazing for all later versions.
### 3. Starlight (https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight)
Starlight is an better alternative to Phosphor, which is created by the same devs as Sodium and Lithium.
### 4. LazyDFU (https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu)
LazyDFU makes the game boot up faster by deferring non essential initialization. Works greatly when paird with the 3 mods above.
### 5. EntityCulling (https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling)
EntityCulling uses async to hide blocks and entities that are not visible by the player, by doing so boosting frames. 
### 6. FerriteCore (https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core)
Ferritecore reduces the memory used by Minecraft by so many ways, like from 5GB to 3.5GB, very helpful for low end and high end pcs.
### 7. Concurrent Chunk Management Engine (https://modrinth.com/mod/c2me-fabric)
This mod optimizes the chunk performance of Minecraft. This is done by taking advantage of of multiple CPU Cores.
### READ BELOW ON HOW TO USE THESE MODS!!!
