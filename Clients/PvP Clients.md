# What are PvP Clients?
To clear everything up, "PvP Clients" are alternative Forge/Fabric modloaders without having access to add your own mods, they aren't special or something new, clients have been a thing for a while now. 

### 1. Lunar Client
The most popular free PvP client thats been mainstream for a while now. The client is pretty much modernized Cheatbreaker, which was taken down after multiple controversies. Lunar Client isn't an unsafe client, it is completely safe, but in the past they have been "exposed" of using mods without permission, like ReplayMod which was created by CrushPixel and johni0702. Lunar mainly got popular by how much partners they have, just going to there store can show a small list of there partners, there is more not shown in the front pages of the store. They make money from selling capes to there users.

Lunar Client is an amazing client, but it is a use-at-your-own-risk client, just like other mods. May be a good option to check it out.

### 2. Badlion Client
Just like Lunar, Badlion is a free PvP client that is available for free at there website. This client used to be extremely popular before Lunar started to become the #1 Client, and is still the second best client after multiple years. There brand new GUI seems like it was a complete Lunar ripoff with a few additions. Ever since Lunar became mainstream, they client has been getting more popular for Skyblock, which is the most popular gamemode in Hypixel (As of March 7, 2023). Their privacy policy seems to state that they have rights to your information. If you have there AntiCheat installed, it runs 24/7 slowing your computer by a LOT. Like I said with Lunar, its just a Forge Modloader without access to adding your own mods.

If your using Badlion, I recommend switching to a more safer option, or just completely uninstalling the AntiCheat.

### 3. Feather Client
Feather was created by the founders of PvPLounge, which was an alright client at the time. It wasn't a popular client at all, actually, it was a pretty dead client. They recently discontinued PvPLounge and created Feather Client. At its beginning it was $12.50 USD, which is already a red flag, like why do players have to pay for a Forge copy and paste. Wait wait wait, a Forge copy and paste? Yeah, it literally was, it was just Forge with downloaded mods. All the devs really did was code a GUI and a Launcher, thats literally it. The main reason people downloaded Feather was because of 2 features. One was being able to add your own mods. Two was voice chat, which is able to be recreated using Mumble Link.

In conclusion, please don't use Feather Client, just download a different client. Its hype ended pretty much in a month after beta release ended. Just use Badlion/Lunar or just Forge

### 4. Forge and Fabric
Probably the best option, Forge with the right mods and fps boosting settings is a bit better then Lunar, which already says a lot. You can download mods from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) and [CurseForge](https://beta.curseforge.com/minecraft)

### 5. MultiMC/Prism
Not much to say, very good launchers, just Forge and Fabric built into a Launcher. Not much to say. Very recommended.

To install Fabric (1.14+) watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL2HtfhhhE.

To install Forge (Pretty much every version, but for more later version, we recommend Fabric) watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSL2HtfhhhE.
